# Matlab_TripletLoss
This is a simple code for tripletloss. I wrote the forward and backward function. 

In fact, the loss only has two (not three) input X and Y .

Here is the relationship between inputs: X = [Xp,Xn]; Y = [Yp,Yn]; 

Xp has the same label with Yp.

Xp has the different label with Yn.

Xn has the different label with Yp.
