# Matlab_TripletLoss
It is a simple code for tripletloss. I wrote the forward and backward function. 

In fact, the inputs has two batches x1,x2 . Here is the relationship:

The first half of x1 has the same label with the first half of x2.
The second half of x1 has the different label with the first half of x2.
The second half of x2 has the different label with the first half of x1.
